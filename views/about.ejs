          <p style="font-size: large;">Journey began with a simple passion and love for fashion, and a desire to create something beautiful, which led to the discovery of the world of beadwork. 
            Inspired by the tradition of handcrafted beadwork, I set out to design luxury beaded handbags and accessories, that blends elegance and personal expression. </p>

            <p style="font-size: large;">
              I saw a gap in the market-many luxury handbags and accessories were mass produced lacking the personal touch of craftsmanship and individuality, I wanted to create a line that not only eluded luxury but told a story via intricate bead work and precision. What started as a hobby learned a junior school, beading for family and friends soon blossomed into a brand. I horned my craft, learnt from different artisans around the world and built a collection that combines timeless designs with expert beadwork.
